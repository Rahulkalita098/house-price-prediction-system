The house price prediction system utilizes a Linear Regression model to estimate the prices of houses based on various socio-economic and structural parameters. The model is trained on features such as crime rate (CRIM), percentage of residential land zoned for lots (ZN), proportion of non-retail business acres (INDUS), proximity to the Charles River (CHAS), nitrogen oxide concentration (NX), number of rooms (RM), age of the property (AGE), distance to employment centers (DIS), accessibility to radial highways (RAD), property tax rate (TAX), pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO), the proportion of the Black population (B), and the percentage of lower-status population (LSTAT). The target variable is the median value of homes (MEDV).

By using Linear Regression, the model identifies relationships between these variables and house prices, offering a continuous prediction of home values. Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful technique, providing interpretable results that help in understanding how each parameter influences the final house price. For example, an increase in the number of rooms (RM) may raise the predicted price, while higher crime rates (CRIM) may lower it.

This prediction system can be used by real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers to estimate house prices based on local factors, guiding better decision-making in property transactions.
